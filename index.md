# Hello

My name’s Iain Wallace. I’m lots of things. Professionally, hard to explain, but you can call me Dr. Wallace. I lead teams doing machiine learning, computer vision, perception and autonomous systems R&D if that makes sense to you. If it doesn’t, know that I strive to make machines smarter, and to help humans work with them better. Privately, I’m a geek. I love gadgets. Mobile. Riding bikes. Taking photos. Tinkering. Thinking.

At present, I'm the Director of Machine Learning and Tracking Research for [Ultraleap](https://www.ultraleap.com). I've held other roles in autonomy and ML with titles like CTO, CSO, Chief Engineer etc. 

You can find me, and contact me, [on LinkedIn here](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/iawallace).
