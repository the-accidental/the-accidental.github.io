# Hello

My name’s Iain Wallace. I’m lots of things. Professionally, hard to explain, but you can call me Dr. Wallace. I lead teams doing machiine learning, computer vision, perception and autonomous systems R&D if that makes sense to you. If it doesn’t, know that I strive to make machines smarter, and to help humans work with them better. Privately, I’m a geek. I love gadgets. Mobile. Riding bikes. Taking photos. Tinkering. Thinking.

Currently I'm a Technical Director at [Faculty AI](https://faculty.ai). For the last 20+ years I've held roles in robotics, autonomy and ML with titles like CTO, CSO, Chief Engineer etc. 

You can find me, and contact me, [on LinkedIn here](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/iawallace).

An archive of my public research, and list of patents, [is online here](research.html).
