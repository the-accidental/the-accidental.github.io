# Social Reasoning in Multi-Agent Systems with the Expectation-Strategy-Behaviour (ESB) Framework

The aim of this section is to give a brief overview of my PhD work, for someone not familiar with the multi-agent systems research area. Of course it’s impossible to cover 4 years of hard work in depth within a few paragraphs, so all I hope to do here is give you a (very) informal intuition as to what it’s about, and pointers to further information and publications. The “ultimate” reference for my PhD work is probably the [most recent journal paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/coin.12014), representing the ideas distilled and refined.
