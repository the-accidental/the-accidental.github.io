# Research

This is a place to collect some info on my publications, and previous research. 
I hope to add some of my current and newer work too, as it becomes public. My work is mostly
in the area of AI in general, and specifically robotics and perception. 

An overview of (my PhD and MSc work is preserved here.)[./phd.html]
